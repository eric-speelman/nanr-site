      <description>Integrate Your Blog or Website With Nanr With just one line of html you can add a Nanr button anywhere on the page. Just one click transfers a Nanr from the person clicking the button to you. Nanr&#39;s can be exchanged for cash - $0.18 per Nanr.
Did we mention that putting a Nanr button on your page is 100% free?
You can make the button as small as 40x40.</description>
